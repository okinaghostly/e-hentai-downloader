# e-hentai-downloader
Made to batch download images from e-hentai with python

To run this code, you need to have Python on your machine. You may also need to install the additional libraries, which are "requests", "bs4", "os" and "urllib".

In the links.txt file, you put all the links to the archives you want to download. It will only download the 20 pages that are in the previous link. Put the link to the next pages of the archive if you want the entire archive to be downloaded.

If ehdownloader.py fails to download, try ehdownloaderv2.py.

The file names are messed up. Use fixer.py and point to the folder name to fix the order of the files.

All of this could be in a single code and could be done better, but I'm too lazy right now.
